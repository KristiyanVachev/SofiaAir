## My documentation: Geocoding for Level 3 Pollutants
#' The level 3 pollutants were geocoding using the Google Maps API however, using google 
#' Sheets extension known as.... (link:).  It is a free alternative to having to 
#' .05 cents every time you want to have to geocode a file.  Since I would have to 
#' explain the geocoding process to people not familar with GIS, I thought it might
#' 

#' The geocoding is very simple and userfriendly, though it can take a bit for the 
#' the plugin to load.  Also it should only be used for nonprofit, educational,
#' or hackathon purposes as it allow allows you to query 10,000 address per day.
#' You first need the address line (so the address, provence, state, country)
#' either in multiple columns or one column.  You then check at least one address
#' in a google search to make sure it looks valid.  Then you check two more to
#' make sure you have enough information.  By doing this you can figure out small
#' errors in the possible search that the google API will make even before you code
#' or run the API request.  Because if google maps cannot figure it out then neither
#' can any of google's services.  

#' Generally the clean up worked like this:
#' 1) Filter and clean the streets by replacing the word "street""
#' 2) 
#' 3)
#' 4)
