#' Need to get elevation of every house and construction site from alitude
#' Don't need it for industrial data as we can assume 10 m.  You can calculate
#' the distances at each internval of the altitude I assume?
#' When I get it down then we will use the elevation with our model or equations
#' you gusy are hopefully coding in python.


#### 1) HOw we are fixing elevation:
#1 ) Get a polygon map of the data instead of point or grid.


#2 ) Do an very advanced type of join of latitude to latitude
#### 2) Doing a geospatial join to get elevation data:

#4 ) Get new elevation for every house and construction site and industry
#5 ) Substract the elevation from either the minimum of the polygon file (min elevation)
#6 ) This gives us a height of every thing in Sofia, Bulgaria \o/ \o/




#7 ) I give the results at .csv or .shap files

# Or google search pandas from shape

#### 2) Fun but not useful ideas to fix elevation: -----

#### 3) Factor Analysis Gaussian Disperation Model links:
#' I am not sure if we are solving for a regression or if we are actually just pluging
#' values.  I have not be able to make factors but here is what I was able to 
#' research in prepeartion s to ask the mentors for help.
